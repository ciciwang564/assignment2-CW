Dataset used:
The dataset used in this analysis is the penguins dataset, which contains information about three penguin species, including their body mass, bill length, flipper length, island location, and sex. This dataset allows for basic descriptive and comparative analysis of physical characteristics across species and genders.

Data analysis script:
The R script, titled penguins_descriptive_analysis.R, performs simple descriptive statistics and visualizations. It calculates the average body mass across species and the average bill length across sexes, then visualizes these results using bar charts to show clear comparisons between groups.

Reproducibility:
To reproduce the analysis, open R or RStudio and load the dataset usingï¼š

penguins <- read.csv("/Users/wangminan/Downloads/penguins.csv")

Then copy and run the provided R commands for summary statistics (summary(), aggregate()) and visualizations (barplot() or ggplot2). Ensure that the file path is updated to match your local directory if necessary.
